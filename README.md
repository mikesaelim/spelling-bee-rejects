# spelling-bee-rejects

The [Spelling Bee game](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) at the New York Times
is great, but everyone can come up with words that didn't make it onto the official list of answers.
What words got rejected?

There already exist [sites](https://nytbee.com/) that do this, but even they leave out more
modern inventions like "bakeable" or "assholeish". So I figured that extracting a word list
from the [English Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/) would give me the most expansive
vocabulary.
